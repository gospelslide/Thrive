# Thive - A heaven for corporate treasurer

As a part of the Barclay's hackathon 2016, we selected problem statement 2 and tried to implement many features. Following is the preview.

## Barclay's Hackathon Problem Statement 2

Corporate Treasurers are rebelling against the traditional methods adopted to manage risk. Rather than using historic balance and transactional data from their bankers, they are looking to drive innovation as a result of new European regulations around account aggregators and payments.

Large Corporate companies today typically have multiple bank accounts with different banks. Each of these accounts will be accessed via separate banking platforms; some are online, some are offline, and all require time and effort to access/analyse. Accounts are often in multiple currencies and across several geographies and require complex payment instruments to send and receive money. The new regulation will allow corporates to view all of their bank accounts on one platform, enabling treasurers to make sure their money is in the right place at the right time and in the right currency.

Corporate Treasurers produce a range of reports for internal and external audiences. These reports take a long time to compile and rely on data from multiple financial and non-financial sources, which can be out of date. The new open banking regulations will potentially allow for real-time data accurate to the second, giving Treasurers the tools to make informed decisions and making it far easier to manage their risks and balances in the short, medium and long term timeframes.
It is your mission to simplify and consolidate the daily banking needs of Corporate Treasurers, by providing a single view experience and simplified payments process:

- How would you display all balance and transactional data/information, from multiple banks, multiple geographies and in multiple currencies, all in one place and in real-time?
- How can financial and non-financial information be presented in a way that helps manage balances in a range of currencies and minimise risk?
- What advanced data/information analytics and predictive analytics can be used to forecast future currency positions in real-time?
- How could historic trend analysis and market/peer group data be used to help Treasurers make more informed decisions?
- How can you simplify/automate the payment process, while giving Treasurers end-to-end control and visibility?
- Can you conquer the Corporate Treasurersâ€™ rebellion and create a consolidated solution that will meet their needs?
